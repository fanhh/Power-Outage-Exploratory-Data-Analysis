# Dataset Overview

## Introduction

This dataset encompasses Major Power Outage Events in the Continental United States, spanning from January 2000 to July 2016. It provides detailed insights into power outages that affected individual U.S. states at the time of occurrence. The dataset comprises over 1541 rows, each representing a unique power outage event, and is crucial for understanding patterns and causes of power outages across different regions and times.

## Central Question

The analysis centers around the question: "Are certain weather conditions, causes of events, or specific months more likely to lead to power outages?" This question is particularly important as it can assist individuals in understanding and potentially avoiding power outages. By analyzing this data, we can provide valuable information for planning travel or residential choices, aiming to reduce the likelihood of experiencing power outages.

## Why This Matters

Understanding the patterns in power outages is crucial for several reasons:

- **Preventive Planning**: Helps in strategic planning to prevent or mitigate outages.
- **Safety and Convenience**: Assists individuals in making informed decisions about travel or residential locations to avoid the inconvenience and potential hazards associated with power outages.
- **Resource Allocation**: Aids utility companies and government agencies in resource allocation and emergency preparedness, particularly in areas and times more susceptible to outages.

## Key Columns in the Dataset

The dataset contains several columns relevant to our central question:

- `CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED`: Number of customers affected by each power outage.
- `MONTH`: The month when the outage occurred.
- `YEAR`: The year when the outage occurred.
- `OUTAGE.DURATION`: The duration of the outage in minutes.
- `DEMAND.LOSS.MW`: The demand loss in megawatts due to the outage.
- `CAUSE.CATEGORY`: The primary cause category of each outage.

These columns provide essential data for analyzing the occurrence and impact of power outages in relation to time (month and year), weather conditions, and their resultant effects.
